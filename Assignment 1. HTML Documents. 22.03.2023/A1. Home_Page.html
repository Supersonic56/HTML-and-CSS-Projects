            <p>Here's a quote I really like:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <strong>"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."</strong> <br> -Nelson Mandela
            </blockquote>        
            <h2>Interested how the dogs can lift you up?</h2>
            <p>You can find soothing pictures and videos of dogs in the tabs below. The dogs can be our motivation when we need more wind in the wings. There will be more pictures and the videos in the future since the website is under development.</p>

                <h3>That's fantastic that we have dogs for friends!</h3>
                <p>Dogs are great therapy pets for many reasons. They provide comfort and companionship, and their presence alone can help reduce stress and anxiety. Their unconditional love and affection can also promote feelings of happiness and improve overall emotional well-being.</p>
